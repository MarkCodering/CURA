## Abstract

This paper introduces CURA, namely, codebase understanding and reasoning agent, an agentic framework designed to enhance codebase understanding and reasoning capabilities in software engineering tasks. CURA employs a two-stage pipeline: the understanding stage and the reasoning stage. The understanding stage leverages both internal and external contexts to map the structure and nuances of the codebase comprehensively. This is followed by the reasoning stage, where the agent engages in iterative planning, problem-solving, and reflective reasoning to improve its approach to the approach reasoning length of the current LLM available. We evaluate CURA using the SWE Bench benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving real-life software engineering problems with increased efficiency and fewer iterations than existing frameworks. Our results suggest that CURA is a significant step towards creating more capable and autonomous agents for software engineering tasks.
